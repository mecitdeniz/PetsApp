# An android app for pets and pet lovers

In this Project, I developed an android application using Java, Spring Boot, Hibernate, MSSQL and
Android Studio. By using this application, animal lovers can adopt a new pet instead of buying one
and also they can create an advert to find a trusted pet sitter when they needed. They can interpret
and score the pet sitters. By doing this they can be sure that their pets are in trusted hands. The
purpose of this application is to reduce pet sales.
